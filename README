Overview
=================================
Giant Caves is a bukkit mod that creates giant underground caves in the world. The caves are generated
using Perlin noise seeded by the world seed. Caves are unique to each world.

Giant Caves is implemented as a bukkit block populator and is compatible with the vanilla world generator
and most likely any world generation plugin that implements the chunk generator pattern. YMMV.


Installation
=================================
Drop GiantCaves.jar into the bukkit plugin directory. It will create its own configuration file with
default configuration options. By default, Giant Caves is configured to work with world managers like
Multiverse and My Worlds. To make Giant Caves work as a stand-alone plugin, set onlyUseWorldManagers
to false.


Configuration
=================================
Within config.yml is a series of key/value pair blocks, one for each world under the "worlds:" key. To bind
Giant Caves to a second world, copy the key/value pair block under the existing block.

Below are extended descriptions of each of the configuration keys:

  name   : world       The name of a world to apply giant caves
                       This value must match the name of the world in the bukkit.yml file for Giant Caves to attach

  sxz    : 200         # Horizontal stretch (larger number = wider cave)
                       This parameter controls the horizontal stretch of the Perlin density map. Making this value
                       larger will stretch the caves horizontally, increasing both the size of the caves and the
                       spacing between them.

  sy     : 100         # Vertical stretch (larger number = taller cave)
                       This parameter controls the vertical stretch of the Perlin density map. Making this value
                       larger will stretch the caves vertically.

  cutoff : 62          Minimum Perlin density cutoff (-100 to 100)
                       This parameter controls the Perlin density cutoff point between cave and not cave. Lowering
                       this value will increase the overall volume and frequency of caves. Raising it will do the
                       opposite. Values outside the range will be treated as the maximum or minimum values.

  miny   : 6           Lower bound of cave zone
                       The lowest block layer Giant Caves will populate.


  maxy   : 50          Upper bound of cave zone
                       The highest block layer Giant Caves will populate.


  debug  : false       Turns on invert mode for experimenting with config values (true/false)
                       When set to true, Giant Caves will fill caves with stone instead of air. Use this feature
                       in combination with an empty world generator like Null Terrain to visualize the generated cave
                       structures. You can use this visualization to experiment with how the different configuration
                       parameters change the structure of the caves.
